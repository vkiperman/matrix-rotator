# Matrix Rotator

Greetings friends.  This is a fun little exercise I developed using AngularJS 1.5, running on Total.js.  The idea was simple enough: take a matrix of data and rotate it clockwise or counterclockwise.

## What to expect.

The interface will enable you to change the number of columns (up to 12) via a range slider. The buttons enable user to rotate the matrix +/-90 degrees.  The content and the color reflect the rotation.

## Please follow the instructions below and enjoy!

`git clone https://github.com/vkiperman/matrix-rotator.git`

### How to run the code.

`cd matrix-rotator`

`npm install total.js`

`cd angularjs`

`node index`

#### Thank you.
